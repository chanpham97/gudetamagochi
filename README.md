# Build A Pet

## Intro

Congratulations! You've just adopted a brand new bunny!

This project is inspired by the [poke the bunny](https://youtu.be/MiVEvAQOV4U?t=8) game from an earlier internet era. You can see a preview of our version [here](https://dom-solutions.glitch.me/pet.html).

## Your Task

Pick an animal of your choosing and find both a happy and grumpy picture of it. Add them both to the `img` directory of this project, and then modify the index.html to show your animal instead of the bunny. You can keep the bunny if you want, but it's more fun to customize it.

Then, make the button clickable so that it keeps tracks of how many times you've pet the animal.

Then, make the animal image switch out for the cranky version when it gets more than its preferred number of pats.

## Extensions

Once that's working, you have so many ways to make this project really cool! Here are some of the ways our students have changed this in the past.
* Make the animal's number of preferred pats random each time the page is loaded.
* Make several different levels of anger - and progress through them as you pet the animal more and more.
* Make the message slightly more responsive - maybe a warning when you start getting close to too many pats.
* Make other buttons like "feed" and "play" and have the image change to a super happy pet if you take perfect care of your pet.
